goDial is an app that uses other services to provide a web app that essentially takes a form from a user, which includes:
1) phone number
2) recipient context
3) objective
4) background context

with this info, the app will make a call to the phone number, using the other fields to validate that the objective is safe, and then using ai-text generation to generate conversational responses.

Using STT and TTS, and generating a realistic voice, the application will, real-time, respond to the call recipient until the 'objective' is considered complete.

The summary of the application will be that: goDial will make calls that you don't want to make, order you a pizza, call a friend, or many friends, and give them a similar update on something you want them to know. Call you gym and cancel you membership, because calling is the only way to cancel, for some reason. If calling people stresses you out, let goDial take care of it for you.
